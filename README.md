# Movie Rating Microservice

A distributed movie rating system built with Go to deepen understanding of microservices architecture.

## Key Features

*   **Microservices Architecture:** The application is broken down into smaller, independent services.
*   **gRPC Communication:** Services communicate with each other using gRPC, a high-performance RPC framework.
*   **Containerization:** The services are containerized using Docker for consistent deployment across different environments.
*   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes is used to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
*   **Service Discovery:** A service discovery mechanism is implemented to allow services to find and communicate with each other dynamically.
